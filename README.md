## WHY:

The internet evolved to a point where we let it safely use our money. In exchange for that, we obtained programmable money. Control over trust, when talking about technology, is a must.

---

## WHO:

The repository targets anyone using our suite of [Smart Contracts](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/#:~:text=A%20%22smart%20contract%22%20is%20simply,a%20type%20of%20Ethereum%20account.) in a C# environment. It can also help you interact with EVMs base functions/standards.

<aside>
👥 The team must have [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/) experienced full-stack developer capable of testing and implementing SC's new features in C#.
